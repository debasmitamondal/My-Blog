	<h2>Immortals of Meluha</h2>
	<p id="first">The emergence from the Neelkanth was a rather series of mysterious events unravelling in th ecourse of time. Shiva was born in the Guna tribe raised by his Uncle Manobhu who actually belonged to the Vayuputras tribe, the tribe responsible for the emergence of the next Mahadev when the evil had taken over good. Little did Shiva know he was going to become the next Mahadev. He and his tribesmen were guided by Nandi upto Meluha from where his actual journey as the Mahadev would begin.By consuming the Somras Shiva's throat turned a hue of cold blue. Ayurvati, the greatest Meluhan doctor to her shock realised that the Neelkanth has emerged and now he must fight against the evil to bring the balance back to the world.</p>
	<p>King Daksha, the emporer of Meluha was on the ninth cloud as he was proud because the Neelkanth had chosen his reign to emerge. The Neelkanth though himself was not sure what evil was and who should he fight to triumph over evil. Emporer Daksha had convinced Shiva that the Chandravanshis were the actual evils and he must fight them. Unable to judge for himself Shiva fought the Chandravanshis valiantly only to realise that they were not the actual evil.</p>
	<p>The Neelkanth was madly in love with Sati, king Daksha's daughter. Sati was a princess who was known for her presence of mind, her extraordinary warrior skills and her beauty. Though she was vikarma Shiva never really bothered about that and going ahead he denounced the vikarma law from Meluha. He never beleived that a person's past life actions could be responsible for their present life physical deformities. He didn't beleive a person should perform penance for someone else's actions. Shiva was a simple minded humble person whose entire life revolved around Sati. Life was unjustified to Sati by first giving her a still born child and then killing her husband but Shiva wanted to fill her life with happiness.</p>

	<h2>The Secret of the Nagas</h2>
	<p>Though Shiva was being highly manipulated by Emporer Daksha by he never lost his presence of mind to distinguish right from wrong so he went on to investigate further the actual evil when he stumbled upon the Malayaputras who helped him think clearly and discover the actual evil which was the Somras <i>(a drink which increased the tenure of human life and is considered the drink of Gods). </i></p>
	<p>On his journey to find evil Shiva discovered that Sati's first born was actually a Naga, so to save Sati from humiliation in the society Daksha sent her child away to Panchavati, a place where the Nagas live in peace. He also found that there was a Somras waste management facility high up in the himalayas which was causing a plague and affecting lakhs of people. The Vayuputras and the Malayaputras were aware of this but was not convinced that Somras was causing any plague. So it was now upto Shiva, the Mahadev, the destroyer of evil to eradicate the cause which was once a boon to this country and has now turned evil.</p>
	<p>Shiva was left with no choice but to declare war on Meluha and destroy the Somras facility. So he gathered all his allies and marched towards Meluha. He was accompanied by the Chandravanshis,the Nagas,the Malayaputras and the Suryavanshis from Lothal. Also he had the <i>daivi astras</i> which was granted to him by the chief of Vayuputras. It ws impossible to defeat him now. So Daksha had to accept his terms or fight against him whom he considered as Lord once.</p>

	<h2>Ram -Scion of Ikshvaku</h2>
	<p>Ram the eldest son of Kaushalya and Dashrath was named after the sixth Vishnu, Lord Parshu Ram. Little did he know that Ram one day would prove himself to be real worthy of his name. It is his misfortune that the day he was born that day Dasrath, the king of Ayodhya, who had never lost a battle in history, had lost to the demon king of Lanka and hence Ram was blamed for his defeat.</p>
	<p>When he was 7 years old, Ram along with his three brothers, Bharat,Lakshman and Shatrughan were sent to a gurukul to gain knowledge in every field necessary to become a good leader one day, uderr the guidance of Ayodhya's raj guru, Maharishi Vashistha. There all the brothers were trained in science, history, geography, philosopy and warrior skills like archery.</p>
	<p>After 16 long years Ram and his brothers returned from gurukul and Ram was announced as the crowned prince of Ayodhya for he had saved King Dasrath's life from a leopard. But destiny didnt want him to become a ruler yet. In an attempt to save Mithila, the kingdom of Sita from the demon king Ravaan, Ram had to fire an Asurashtra which is a forbidden weapon by the previous Mahadev, Lord Rudra. So he was banished for 14 years to live in exile.</p>
	<p>Ram was accompanied by his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman when he became acquainted with Jatayu, a Malayaputra who had sworn to save Sita.But in an accident in the forest Lakshman had cut off Surpanakha's nose, who is Ravaan's sister. So to avenge her Ravaan kidnapped Sita.</p>

	<h2>Ravaan - Enemy of Aryavarta</h2>
	<p>Ravaan was born in a Brahminical family, the son of Rishi Vishrava and Kaikesi. From a very young age Ravaan was very talented in music, science and philosophy and loved to perform heinous science experiments. On one such occasion of experiments he met the Kanyakumari who was beleived to be a living Goddess and her kind words made him fall in love with her. But destiny couldn't accept his love for the events which would occur in his life would lead him to become one the greatest villains of history.</p>
	<p>The day his brother Kumbhakarna was born he and his mother and his uncle had to fled the village because Kumbhakarna was born a Naga and Vishrava was not going to take any more humiliations, which he beleived was for the bad karma of his wife, Kaikesi.The responsibility of his family fell on the little shoulders of Ravaan which made him more practical and ruthless. He started his journey as a small smuggler but through and hardwork and brilliant tactics he went on to become the ruler of Lanka.</p>
	<p>When he was an adult, Ravaan found his long lost love, the Kanyakumari. But she was a women now who was married to a noble person named Prithvi and was pregnant and was settled in a village named Todee near Vaidyanath. Ravaan went their with the expection of offering his husband huge sum of money and bringing her to Lanka but on the contrary Vedavati <i>(the Kanyakumari)</i> had motivated him to better a person. But fate had some other  plans for Ravaan, because his one and only love, Vedavati was ruthlessly killed by the village's landlord's son Sukarma over a hundi<i>(a sum of amount which was given by Ravaan for the progress of her village)</i> and this led Ravaan to become the villain which India remembers him as today.</p>

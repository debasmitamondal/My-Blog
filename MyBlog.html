	<h2>Immortals of Meluha</h2>
	<p id="first">The emergence from the Neelkanth was a rather series of mysterious events unravelling in th ecourse of time. Shiva was born in the Guna tribe raised by his Uncle Manobhu who actually belonged to the Vayuputras tribe, the tribe responsible for the emergence of the next Mahadev when the evil had taken over good. Little did Shiva know he was going to become the next Mahadev. He and his tribesmen were guided by Nandi upto Meluha from where his actual journey as the Mahadev would begin.By consuming the Somras Shiva's throat turned a hue of cold blue. Ayurvati, the greatest Meluhan doctor to her shock realised that the Neelkanth has emerged and now he must fight against the evil to bring the balance back to the world.</p>
	<p>King Daksha, the emporer of Meluha was on the ninth cloud as he was proud because the Neelkanth had chosen his reign to emerge. The Neelkanth though himself was not sure what evil was and who should he fight to triumph over evil. Emporer Daksha had convinced Shiva that the Chandravanshis were the actual evils and he must fight them. Unable to judge for himself Shiva fought the Chandravanshis valiantly only to realise that they were not the actual evil.</p>
	<p>The Neelkanth was madly in love with Sati, king Daksha's daughter. Sati was a princess who was known for her presence of mind, her extraordinary warrior skills and her beauty. Though she was vikarma Shiva never really bothered about that and going ahead he denounced the vikarma law from Meluha. He never beleived that a person's past life actions could be responsible for their present life physical deformities. He didn't beleive a person should perform penance for someone else's actions. Shiva was a simple minded humble person whose entire life revolved around Sati. Life was unjustified to Sati by first giving her a still born child and then killing her husband but Shiva wanted to fill her life with happiness.</p>

	<h2>My Second Article</h2>
	<p>The world has seen the emergence of a Novel Corona Virus on 31 December 2019, officially referred to as COVID-19. The virus was first isolated from persons with pneumonia in Wuhan city, China. The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from ranging from mild illness to pneumonia. Symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches. In severe cases difficulty in breathing and deaths can occur.</p>
	<p>As of May 8, two medicationsTrusted Source had received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): the antiviral remdesivir and a drug used to sedate people on a ventilator.The FDA issued an EUA in March for the antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but later revoked itTrusted Source after studies showed that theyâ€™re unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19.</p>
	<p>Developed a decade ago, this drug failed in clinical trials against Ebola in 2014. But it was found to be generally safe in people. Research with MERS, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, showed that the drug blocked the virus from replicating.The drug is being tested in many COVID-19 clinical trials around the world. This includes studies in which remdesivir is being administered alongside other drugs, such as the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib</p>

	<h2>Ram -Scion of Ikshvaku</h2>
	<p>Ram the eldest son of Kaushalya and Dashrath was named after the sixth Vishnu, Lord Parshu Ram. Little did he know that Ram one day would prove himself to be real worthy of his name. It is his misfortune that the day he was born that day Dasrath, the king of Ayodhya, who had never lost a battle in history, had lost to the demon king of Lanka and hence Ram was blamed for his defeat.</p>
	<p>When he was 7 years old, Ram along with his three brothers, Bharat,Lakshman and Shatrughan were sent to a gurukul to gain knowledge in every field necessary to become a good leader one day, uderr the guidance of Ayodhya's raj guru, Maharishi Vashistha. There all the brothers were trained in science, history, geography, philosopy and warrior skills like archery.</p>
	<p>After 16 long years Ram and his brothers returned from gurukul and Ram was announced as the crowned prince of Ayodhya for he had saved King Dasrath's life from a leopard. But destiny didnt want him to become a ruler yet. In an attempt to save Mithila, the kingdom of Sita from the demon king Ravaan, Ram had to fire an Asurashtra which is a forbidden weapon by the previous Mahadev, Lord Rudra. So he was banished for 14 years to live in exile.</p>
	<p>Ram was accompanied by his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman when he became acquainted with Jatayu, a Malayaputra who had sworn to save Sita.But in an accident in the forest Lakshman had cut off Surpanakha's nose, who is Ravaan's sister. So to avenge her Ravaan kidnapped Sita.</p>
